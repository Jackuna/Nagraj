# NagRaj : dashing-nagios

### Under Development

Flat Nagios Dashing Dashboard based on Dashing project.
This Nagios Dashboard can be integrated with Nagios Core and NagiosXI both.
I have designed it to fit big monitors/TV screens kept within floor, to monitor on the way.


It has cool features like

* Cool dashboard with responsive layouts and Hotness Indicators [ Red & Green ]  and 

* Responsive Meter Widgets.

* Show your Custom Logo.

* 12 Hours Clock.

* Scrolling Message of the day or Informations to display at the bottom.

* Show Weather status with frequently changing color of dashlets and logo based on weather types.

* Every Host and Service dashlet has a meter with changing color scheme depending upon severity.
